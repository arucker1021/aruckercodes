            <h3>Microsoft Virtual Academy (homepage learning path image fully responsive)</h3>
            <p>
                I worked with the designers for the Microsoft Virtual Academy website to take their graphics to make a fully responsive and accessible link on the Homepage.  
                The graphic and content associated with it helped users know that a new feature was available and the link took them to explore learning paths.

            <h3>Microsoft Virtual Academy Reward Evidence Responsiveness</h3>
            <p>
                I reworked the HTML and CSS of the Reward Evidence page that displays the badge that a user either receives from the "Know It. Prove It" campaign or the normal learning paths.
                The changes I made allowed the page to be usable and visually appealing at all resolutions.

            <h3>Microsoft Professional Program</h3>
            <p>
                Due to a search engine optimization issue that caused the page to not be crawled becuase of Angular JS, I was tasked with stripping out the Angular code and replicating the code in Razor syntax
                once the JSON had been transformed into a data structure.

            <h3>Internal UX Accessibility Site</h3>
            <p>
                I worked with the other accessibility engineer on my team to help flesh out the internal accessibility website we created to provide developers with code snippets 
                for common functional elements such as Tables, Menus, Dropdowns, etc.

            <h3>Congress Plus Filters</h3>
            <p>
                I changed the current implementation of filters for Congress Plus from a multi page implementation to a single modal window popup on the grid page that displayed the Congressmen and women.
                I used jQuery and HTML to create a modal window that turned the entire filter into a single window app so all filters could be changed and saved on the fly while displaying subtle cues that 
                the user has changed fiters from what they were before.

            <h3>Congress Plus Townhall Integration</h3>
            <p>
                I integrated new database changes that added Congressmen and women's townhall meeting information to the product. I took that information and integrated it with Congress Plus to 
                create a user interface that was simple and easy to use to display meetings.

            <h3>Cancer.gov Navigation</h3>
            <p>
                I restructured the html and xml of the navigation to reduce publishing times for the entire site from 3<span class="sr-only"> plus</span><span aria-hidden="true">+</span> hours to just over 
                1 hour.  Making this improvement allowed for other developers to run full publishes whenever they needed to make changes that affected the full site.

            <h3>Cancer.gov Blog Implementation</h3>
            <p>
                I implemented blog functionality for the content management system so any content owners could create their own blogs and blog posts and have them appear on the site.  I worked with designers
                and the site architect for implementing this feature that is still in use today.
