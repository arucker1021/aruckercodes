            <p>Hello All</p>
            <p>
                I am Antony Rucker (preferred name is Tony).  I have created this site to showcase my front-end development capabilities and to showcase 
                the rest of my Work History and Projects that may have been excluded from my resume.  This site is the comprehensive list of everything I have worked
                on in my professional career. I studied at the University of Virginia and have a Bachelors in Computer Science and graduated in 2013.  I have been in the field 
                now for 4 years and am eventually looking to be an a technology manager position.
            </p>
            <p>
                I hope you enjoy this site and that is helpful in giving you a better overview of who I am and what I am capable of.
